# Hi

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stephenpalgeorge. I'm a full-stack developer based in London, UK. I'm currently working at the charity 'Christian Aid', helping to look after our [main website](https://www.christianaid.org.uk) and currently working on building a brand new donations platform.

## Other projects that I'm working on:
- **Finch CSS**: a sass tooling library, written to make building scalable styles with Sass as good a DX as possible (in my opinion, of course).
- **In the House API**: an API, written with the Express.js framework, that exposes political data for the UK House of Parliament.

## Portfolio pieces:
- [**Neil George Photography**](https://www.neilgeorgephotography.co.uk/): Portfolio website for the photography Neil George (who happens to be my Dad). Written with React and Firebase (and a tiny Express.js server).
- [**Number Base**](http://number-base.surge.sh/): A beautiful visualisation of binary counting, written with Svelte. [See the code](https://github.com/stephenpalgeorge/number-base)
